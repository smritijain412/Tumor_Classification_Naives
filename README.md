# tumour-classification
Tumour Classification using Naive Bayes classifier  algorithm.
Naive Bayes theorme is traditional approach for classification.
In this file  code is  from scratch using python and use statistics and probability.
Python packages  are used in this numpy,pandas and matplotlib.
Conditional Probability in this code:-
p(result='1'| condition1='value'^ condition2='value')=p(condition1^condition2| result).p(result)/p(condition1^condition2| result).p(result)+p(result ^ condition2 | result2)
scipy library is used for statistics
we need to check that determinant value of covarience matrix should be positive.
